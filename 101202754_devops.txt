Definition
Academics and practitioners have not developed a unique definition for the term "DevOps".[a][b][c][d]
From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu—three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute—suggested defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality".[6]
The term DevOps, however, has been used in multiple contexts.

History
In 2009, the first conference named devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded by Belgian consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois.[8][who?][9] The conference has now spread to other countries.[10]
In 2012, the State of DevOps report was conceived and launched by Alanna Brown at Puppet.[11][12] As of 2014, the annual State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble and others.[13][14] In 2014, they found that DevOps adoption was accelerating.[13] Also in 2014, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote the book More Agile Testing, containing a chapter on testing and DevOps.
